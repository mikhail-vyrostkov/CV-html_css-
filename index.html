    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I started studying programming at the institute. Tried programming in C ++ to solve various
      mathematical modeling problems. Later I became very interested in the Java language. I've been
      studying it for a year. I am taking courses on java development from the Skillbox school. I
      have experience in Spring Framework, worked with databases. Worked through the git version
      control system. During his studies, he constantly interacted with various Internet resources
      (Javarush, sql-ex.ru, habr.com, etc.).
      My goals for the near future are to start developing high-load web applications, master the
      currently popular frameworks and start growing and developing professionally as a developer.
      My strengths include the ability to work in a team, the desire to find the most effective and
      beautiful solution, the ability to independently search for resources that will help solve a
      problem or improve my professional level, a great interest in developing web applications.
      I am considering internships, project activities, office work, telecommuting.
